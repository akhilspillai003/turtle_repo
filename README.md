# turtle_repo

This repository includes all the python turtle codes that I tried in my first year of engineering, where I studied Python for the first time.
You can go through all these codes.

I have included codes of:
  1) Circle-Spirograph
  2) Doraemon
  3) Pikachu
  4) Robert-Downey-Jr.
  5) Virus-model
  6) Design 

All these codes are done by me by refering the internet, these are not created by me these were done as part of me learning python.
